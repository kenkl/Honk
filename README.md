I've been taking the "iOS 13 & Swift 5 - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp" on Udemy (Angela Yu), and she encourages us to "play" - exploring things that were touched on in the course, take other tutorials, read articles/documentation, build our own educational projects, etc. Since being an iPhone user since 2009, this is the first time I've actually crafted native code for the platform. It's... kinda fun.

With this thing, I'm dipping into auto-layout (I do struggle a little with its complexity, for some reason), as well as absorbing/adopting the MVC Design Model. 

A few months ago, someone on one of my feeds posted a collection of goose sounds from the excellent [Untitled Goose Game](https://goose.game/). They've been hanging about in a directory on my disk for a while - until I had a clever idea - let's wrap those into a soundboard, using what I've learnt so far in the course, and my own exploration. Google Image Search was also very helpful.

So, here it is - my own "Horrible Goose Sounds" soundboard. I'm well aware that it's pretty amateur-hour stuff, but it _is_ A Thing I made. So.
